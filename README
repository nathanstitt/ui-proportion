   This is an implementation of what I call a proportion widget.  I'ts useful for the cases where you need to split a given value into multiple pieces.

      It's implemented as a slider with multiple handles and labels in between the handles. As a handle's are dragged, labels are moved to represent the values of the inner space between them.

      It's a follow up to the proportion widget I wrote several years ago for the prototype based scripty2 library, except written for the JQuery UI slider.

      It's still very new and being tested internally.  It has not been used it on a live site yet.  Use at your own risk, etc.

      You can view an example of it on my site at: http://nathan.stitt.org/ui-proportion/
