This is the beginnings of what I've dubbed a proportion widget.  I've not seen one used before on the interwebs, but find it useful for the case where you need to split a given value into multiple pieces.

Internally, it creates a slider with multiple handles, and as the handle's are dragged, labels are moved to represent the values of the inner space between them.

It's a follow up to the proportion widget I wrote for the prototype based scripty2 library, except written for the JQuery UI slider.

It's still very incomplete, but am at the stage where I've written enough code that it needs to get checked in and tracked.

Don't expect to use it and have it do anything useful for you as yet :)
