This is what I've dubbed a proportion widget.  I've not seen one used before on the interwebs, but find it useful for the case where you need to split a given value into multiple pieces.

It's implemented as a slider with multiple handles and labels in between the handles. As a handle's are dragged, labels are moved to represent the values of the inner space between them.

It's a follow up to the proportion widget I wrote for the prototype based scripty2 library, except written for the JQuery UI slider.

It's still very fresh, and is still in testing mode internally.  Use at your own risk, etc.
